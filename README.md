## Installation & Usage

To install this module `cd` to your project directory and enter the following command:
```
yarn add react-native-windows-hello
```
or
```
npm install react-native-windows-hello --save
```

After having it installed you can call all the Windows Hello methods through the `SignIn` class, so the usage would be:
```javascript
const signIn = new SignIn();
signIn.getConsentMessage()
  .then(result => {
    Alert.alert("SUCCESS", `${result}`);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    Alert.alert("ERROR:", `${error}`);
  });
```

Check out the [example project](example) for more examples.

## API

The following library provides you with the native modules exposing the following methods:

| Method | Description | Returns |
| ------ | - | - |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.checkAvailabilityPromise` | Gets the status of biometric device on a user's machine and returns a promise with the result | `Promise` with `String` |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.requestScanPromise` | Displays the biometric scan prompt as a popup and returns a promise after user's actions | `Promise` with `String` |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.checkAvailabilityCallback` | Gets the status of biometric device on a user's machine and launches a callback with the result as a callback's parameter | Callback(`String`) |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.requestScanCallback` | Displays the biometric scan prompt as a popup and returns a result through a callback | Callback(`String`) |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.checkAvailabilityAsync` | Gets the status of biometric device on a user's machine and returns an empty callback, which acts as a notification about launching the request. The result of that action should be then manually fetched by running `getLastAvailabilityCheckResult` | Callback() |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.requestScanAsync` | Displays the biometric scan prompt as a popup and returns an empty callback after user's actions, which acts as a notification about launching the request. The result of that action should be then manually fetched by running `getLastScanResult` | Callback() |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.getLastScanResult` | Returns a promise with last result of a biometric device status | `Promise` with `String` |
| `SignIn`<br/>`.getLastAvailabilityCheckResult` | Returns a promise with last result of a biometric signing in result | `Promise` with `String` |
