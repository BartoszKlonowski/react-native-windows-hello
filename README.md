## Installation & Usage

To install this module `cd` to your project directory and enter the following command:

```console
yarn add -D react-native-windows-hello
```
or
```console
npm install react-native-windows-hello --save
```

After having it installed you can import all the Windows Hello features like so:

```javascript
import { SignIn, verificationResult, availabilityStatus } from 'react-native-windows-hello';
```

The [API](#API) contains two methods: `requestConsentVerification` and `getDeviceStatus` each returning a promise with result object containing both `value` and `message` with pre-defined text (in english) describing the returned result.
<br/>So the example of usage would be:

```javascript
SignIn.requestConsentVerification("This customized message will be displayed in biometric prompt")
  .then(result => {
    Alert.alert(
      `${result === verificationResult.Verified ? "SUCCESS" : "ERROR"}`,
      result.message
    );
  })
  .catch(error => {
    Alert.alert("ERROR:", `${error}`);
  });
```

Check out the [example project](example) for more examples.

## API

The following library provides you with the native modules exposing the following methods:

| **Method** & Description | Arguments | Returns |
| - | :-: | - |
| **SignIn.getDeviceStatusMessage** | | |
| Gets the status of biometric device on a user's machine and returns a promise with the result.<br/>The returned promise is resolved if the status is OK, and is rejected in case of any issues with a device or biometric feature availability. | - | `Promise` with `String` |
| **SignIn.getConsentMessage** | | |
| Displays the biometric scan prompt as a popup and returns a promise after user's actions.<br/>The returned promise is resolved if the verification was successful, and is rejected in case of failed verification (user cancelled the verification, number of tries was exceeded, etc.),<br/>or when incorrect `promptMessage` has been passed as an argument.| `promptMessage : String`<br/>Additional text which will be placed in the login prompt popup.<br/> | `Promise` with `String` |
